# inflammation_project
This project investigates the complex relationship between micronutrient levels, inflammation, and anemia in pregnant women. Using advanced statistical analysis, we develop a predictive model that considers both micronutrient concentrations and inflammatory markers (C-reactive Protein) to assess anemia risk during pregnancy.
